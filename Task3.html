        <h1>TASK-3</h1>
        <h2 style="text-align: center;">Structure of URL</h2>
        <p>The URL (Uniform Resource Locator) is the address used to access resources on the internet. It consists of several components: the protocol, domain name, path, and optional query strings. A properly structured URL ensures efficient and accurate resource identification. Understanding URL structure is crucial for web navigation and optimization.</p>

        <h2>Agile Methodology</h2>
        <p>Agile methodology is a modern approach to software development that emphasizes flexibility and collaboration. It focuses on delivering small, incremental changes to meet evolving customer needs. Agile promotes iterative cycles, regular feedback, and continuous improvement to enhance project success and adaptability.</p>
        <p>Working: Agile involves breaking projects into smaller tasks, conducting regular team meetings, and ensuring quick delivery of working software in short iterations.</p>

        <h2>Waterfall Methodology</h2>
        <p>The Waterfall methodology is a traditional linear approach to project management. It divides a project into distinct sequential phases: Requirements, Design, Implementation, Testing, Deployment, and Maintenance. This method works well for projects with well-defined requirements and minimal changes.</p>
        <p>Working: Each phase must be completed before moving on to the next. Testing occurs only after the implementation phase is completed.</p>

        <h2>DevOps</h2>
        <p>DevOps is a collaborative approach combining development and operations teams to enhance the software development lifecycle. It emphasizes automation, integration, and continuous delivery to speed up deployment and improve quality.</p>
        <p>Working: DevOps uses tools and practices to automate testing, deployment, and monitoring, enabling seamless software delivery and enhanced team collaboration.</p>
